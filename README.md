# ML-Classification-Bank-Marketing
Banks would like to be able to choose among their customers exactly those who are most likely to take advantage of a particular offer, and contact them.

We have data on the latest marketing campaign conducted by the bank: the task was to attract customers to open a deposit. We've to analyze this data, identify patterns and find the decisive factors that influenced the fact that the client invested money in this particular bank. If we can do this, we will raise the bank's income and help understand the target audience that needs to be attracted through advertising and various offers.

## Business task: 
to determine the characteristics by which it is possible to identify customers who are more inclined to open a deposit in a bank, and thereby increase the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. As a data scientist we need to build a machine learning model that, based on the proposed characteristics of the client, will predict whether he will take advantage of the offer to open a deposit or not.

## Data Science Lifecycle:

1. Primary data processing - Data Cleaning

   Working with missing values and outliers in the data. 

2. EDA

   Spreading measures /
   Histograms /
   Correlation analyis

3. Feature Engineering - Selection and transformation of features

   In this step, we will transform the data so that it can be used in solving a classification problem. 

4. Classification: Logistic Regression and Decision Trees
   
   Building first predictive model and evaluate its quality. Selection the optimal model parameters in order to get the best result for a particular algorithm.

5. Classification: ensembles of models and forecasting

   Refining prediction using more complex algorithms. Evaluation which model can be used to make better predictions.
